# Write you a programming language

### Overview

Originally, I follow most traditional course and trying to tell how to make a programming language from technology view, but I quickly found how wrong it is. The problem is because we already has a lot of language, if a language is bad, there has no need to create it. Existed tutorials already enough to help anyone make a compiler, but how to design a good language is a question, I won't try to say what I made is the best, but giving a lot of indenpendent features, and let readers feel the core concept behind them to help readers make a good design.
