# Overview

Originally, I follow most traditional course and trying to tell how to make a programming language from technology view, but I quickly found how wrong this way. Because we already have a lot of language, another bad language is not need. Existed tutorials already enough to help anyone make a compiler, but how to design a good language is a question, you would usually need to read tons of books in PLT(Programming Language Theory) this area, and be carefully to avoid be killed by math. I won't try to say what I made is the best, but giving a lot of independent features, and let readers feel the core concept behind them to help readers make a good design.
